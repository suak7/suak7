# Hi, I am Sumeyya
<p>I am a full-stack developer in training, crafting services mainly using Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL. I have foundational knowledge on operating systems and data structures and algorithms. Although being a full-stack developer is already exhilarating, I hope to narrow down my career niche to machine learning, high-performance computing, or systems programming. I am aware each area is a vast field on its own; I will deeply explore my interests that academically and emotionally fulfill me.</p>

## Projects
Incoming Project(s):
<ul>
  <li>Project ReefDirect – Design a full-stack web application to provide researchers, students, and environmental enthusiasts with real-time coral reef data. Users will be able to access, analyze, and visualize key reef health metrics such as temperature, pH, coral cover, and bleaching rates. The platform will support downloading datasets and generating visual analytics to assist in research, trend analysis, and environmental monitoring.</li>
</ul>

Past Project(s):
<ul>
  <li>Project ESR Signal Classifier – Developed a machine learning-based classifier for electron spin resonance (ESR) signals. The aim was to automatically analyze and categorize ESR spectra, enabling faster and more accurate interpretation of experimental data. The system identifies key features in ESR signals, distinguishes between different signal types, and provides a robust tool for research in chemistry, physics, and material science.</li>
</ul>

## Skills
<ul>
  <li>Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li>PyTorch, Flask</li>
  <li>Git, GitHub, Figma</li>
  <li>NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLite</li>
  <li>Postman</li>
