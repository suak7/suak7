# Hi, I am suak7

<p>I am currently a freshman Computer Science student, aspired to learn more about software development and all things tech! My recent work includes a PyTorch classifier achieving 95% accuracy on spectral data. I particularly enjoy low-level programming and reading about the inner workings of operating systems.</p>

Learn more about me on my [personal website](<https://suak7.github.io/>)!
