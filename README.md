# Hi, I am suak7
<p>I am a full-stack developer in training, crafting services mainly using Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL. I have foundational knowledge on operating systems and data structures and algorithms. Although being a full-stack developer is already exhilarating, I hope to narrow down my career niche to machine learning, high-performance computing, or systems programming. I am aware each area is a vast field on its own; I will deeply explore my interests that academically and emotionally fulfill me.</p>
